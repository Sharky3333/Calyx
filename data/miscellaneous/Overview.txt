CS Seminar Project Proposal v2


	My project proposal is an application that aids home gardeners in planning their
	crop rotations. This app will use geographical and crop information to help home
	gardeners while also promoting the planting of more local varieties of
	vegetables. The majority of the project will consist of database management,
	data visualization, and building the plant recommendation system.
