ðŸŒ± 5-Week Roadmap: Gardening Application


	Week 1: Research, Planning & Backend Setup

		Research & Data Collection
			Identify crop & pest databases (USDA, OpenWeatherMap, university extensions).
			Find soil health data sources (federal databases or user-submitted results).
			Define core feature set to prioritize for a minimum viable product (MVP).

		Backend Architecture
			Set up Spring Boot backend (REST API structure).
			Define database schema (PostgreSQL/MongoDB).
			Develop endpoints for:
				/crops (GET, POST, UPDATE)
				/pests (GET, POST)
				/soil (GET, POST, UPDATE)
				/alerts (GET, POST)
		Python Data Processing Setup
			Use Flask/FastAPI for soil test analysis & crop recommendations.
			Start processing crop and pest data for storage.


	Week 2: Core Backend Features & Basic UI

		Backend Features
			Implement Crop Recommendation System (soil, region, season-based).
			Integrate Pest Warning System (fetch pest activity by region).
			Develop Soil Health Tracking (store & update user soil tests).

		Frontend (JavaFX) Setup
			Create basic UI layout (profile selection, home screen, crop selection).
			Implement Garden Planner UI (basic layout for mapping garden space).
			Build Crop Selection Interface (searchable list of crops).
		
		
	Week 3: Data Visualization & Calendar Integration

		Enhancing Backend Functionality
			Fetch weather data (OpenWeatherMap API) for 7-day forecast.
			Implement Dynamic Pest Updates (new pest alerts as data updates).

		Frontend UI Components
			Create Soil Health Bar Chart (visualizing soil test results).
			Generate Gantt Chart for crop rotation.
			Implement export feature (PDF/PNG/CSV for charts & recommendations).

		Alert System
			Implement notifications for weather events & pest threats.


	Week 4: Testing, Debugging & Finalizing Features

		Testing & Debugging
			Unit test database queries & API endpoints.
			Ensure crop recommendations & pest alerts are accurate.
			Verify weather API integration & soil health calculations.

		Final UI Improvements
			Improve garden planner usability.
			Test chart accuracy & export functionality.
			Implement mascot animation (if time allows).


	Week 5: Deployment, Documentation & Presentation

		Deployment
			Deploy backend (Spring Boot) on cloud (Heroku/AWS/Railway).
			Host database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB) on a cloud service.
			Package frontend (JavaFX) as a desktop application.

		Final Documentation
			Write setup guide & API documentation.
			Create final presentation & demo video.
			Upload code to GitHub with an open-source license.
