An application that aids home gardeners in planning crop rotations.

My project proposal is an application that aids home gardeners in planning their crop rotations. This app will use geographical and crop information to help home gardeners while also promoting the planting of more local varieties of vegetables. The majority of the project will consist of database management, data visualization, and building the plant recommendation system.
