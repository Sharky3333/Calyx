### Overview
My project proposal is an application that aids home gardeners in planning their crop rotations. This app will use geographical and crop information to help home gardeners while also promoting the planting of more local varieties of vegetables. The majority of the project will consist of database management, data visualization, and building the plant recommendation system.

### Key Features
  - Crop recommendation system
		  A database with crop requirements the app will use the data of recommended planting time, germination time, and regionality to pick the best crops.
		    Recommends a companion plant that will help with soil health
			
	- Pest warning system
		  Regional pest information from federal agencies along with along with	regional location information will determine the best time to plant and the	pest to look out for.
		
	- Soil health information‚ÇÅ
		  A bar chart that has the estimated pH Level, Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K),	and Nitrogen (N).
			  Logging soil additives and minerals estimate soil health over time.
			
	- UI Garden planner
		  The garden sizing addition gives proper crop spacing, helps them to map out	their space efficiently, and know the proper amount of seeds needed.
		
	- Gantt chart that has the planned crop rotation.
		  This will display the planned crops for the next four seasons.
		
	- Document sheet that can come in the form of a PNG, PDF, or CSV.
		  Crop table with seeds needed, spacing, and companion plants
		
	- General-purpose alert box that tells the gardener of any critical information.
	
	- A calendar that shows weather predictions for the next 7 days.
		  Warns of weather events that could pose harm
